# Small-office-network-packet-tracer

The goal of this project was to build a basic small office network and understand how devices are connected using appropriate cables and topology, and how IP addressing, routers, and switches work together.

## Topology:
- 3 PCs
- 1 switch
- 1 router

## What I did : 
- Manually assigned IP addresses to all hosts
- Configured the router as the default gateway.
- Assigned an IP address to the router interface.
- Tested network connectivity using the ping command from a PC to the router.

## What I learned:
- How to choose IP addresses within a subnet. 
- The roles of a switch versus a router. 
- Basic network topology design.
- Fundamental Packet Tracer and Cisco CLI commands.
